     The measured levels can exceed the allowed values in specific cases and in such cases, the engines need an exhaust treatment using a three way catalyst or a similar system to limit the emissions to allowed levels.

     Limits for dioxin in various western countries expressed as tolerable daily in- take are typically, 1 to 10 pg per kg bodyweight (1 pg =10~'2Â¢).

     Because the toxicity is high even at low levels, and all improvements are related to bringing the mag- nitude to very low levels fine measurement systems are required to be designed to obtain these values accurately.

     Strategies for emission reduction

     The emission of CO, can be brought down only by improving the efficiency of the process that uses any of the fuels (reducing kg fuel per unit product output, the output being electricity or a certain distance moved or a physical product).
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 447 1532 2180 1743;">
     Replac- ing fossil fuels by renewable fuels (that can be generated at least at the same rate as its use) so that neutrality of CO, production is achieved is another approach ac- tively being pursued in recent times.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 446 1700 2180 1856;">
     The argument that if we replace fossil fuels by biomass it is adequate to meet the obligation of CO, reduction has some subtle aspects.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 641 1813 2179 1848;">
     Biomass is used as the primary fuel in stoves for domestic applications.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 448 1870 2180 1961;">
     In most parts of the world, the stove is operated with inadequate air-to-fuel ratio control leading to emissions of UHC and CO.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 447 1927 2183 2082;">
     This is partly due to stoves being used in regions where no electricity is available, and so the ever varying and fluc- tuating inflow of air into the combustion space due to buoyancy is all a certainty.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 447 2096 2182 2252;">
     The greenhouse effect of some of these gases is substantive andit is argued that a well-managed fossil fuel stove would produce lesser green house gas effect in com- parison to poorly burning biomass stove.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 448 2209 2180 2356;">
     The key requirement then is to ensure a biomass stove design that delivers high combustion efficiency, something that is consistent with the burning of pollutants as completely as possible.

     The CO emission from industrial sources is minimized by ensuring some excess air and a good mixing of the fuel and the air.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 447 2674 2182 2764;">
     Increased excess air implies larger in-house power consumption for delivering this air.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 447 2729 2180 2820;">
     Hence, careful optimization is needed to allow a minimum of excess air.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 447 2785 2180 2877;">
     In the case of automobiles, one needs to use a catalyst to burn off the more-than-prescribed CO.
