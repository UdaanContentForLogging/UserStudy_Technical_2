     EGR: The use of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) reduces the flame temperature for both premixed and non-premixed flames.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 561 489 2181 693;">
     There are ways of arranging EGR in combustion chambers in which the oxidiser and fuel jets are introduced sepa- rately at high velocity (50 to 100 m/s) from a base so that the burnt gases are entrained into the fuel and oxidiser streams.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 561 659 2183 862;">
     This process allows the mixing to occur without reaction till a stage when the fuel and the oxidiser fractions have been brought down to low levels while the temperature has risen to about 1200 K.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 561 827 2180 919;">
     In this condition the entire system works almost like a stirred reac- tor.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 561 884 2181 983;">
     This process reduces the peak temperature by about 100 to 150 K and helps reduce the emission of thermal NO,.

     Air preheat: Use of preheated air for the same flame temperature allows very lean operation and hence decrease in prompt NO generation.

     UHC

   <p class="ocr_par" id="par_1_5" lang="eng" title="bbox 446 1437 2187 1932">
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 446 1437 2180 1585;">
     Release of UHC from industrial burners is not a very serious issue because ample residence time can usually be given to the reactants inside the combustion cham- ber.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 447 1550 2180 1642;">
     Meeting the UHC emission standards for diesel engines calls for fine atom- ization of diesel and good mixing of it with air inside the cylinders.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 447 1607 2187 1811;">
     In the case of spark-ignition engines the emission standard is met by fitting a catalyst, generally a three-way catalyst, which achieves simultaneously the oxidation of UHC, CO and the reduction of NO.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 447 1777 2180 1932;">
     For this to be possible, the mixture has to be very close to sto- ichiometric condition, which motivates partly the use of complex electronic engine management control systems in modern cars.

    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 447 1970 2180 2069;">
     The exhaust is passed over a usually precious metal surface of platinum, nickel, rhodium, etc, that has a very high surface area.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 448 2027 2181 2175;">
     The action of the metal is to cat- alyze the particular reactions related to oxidation of UHC and CO and the reduction of NO to NÂ», so that its rate is high even at low temperatures (~ 400-900 K).
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 447 2141 2180 2344;">
     The mechanism of catalysis involves the diffusion of the reactants towards the surface, their adsorption by the metal surface, particularly in the active sites where the re- actants meet to form the product.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 447 2309 2181 2513;">
     This product is then desorbed back to the gas phase, to be removed by mass transfer (diffusion) into the bulk stream (adsorption means a chemical bonding between the reactant molecule and the atom (s) on the metal and desorption implies the breaking of this bond).
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 447 2478 2187 2626;">
     The rate of the overall process depends on the nature of the catalyst, the temperature, and the fluxes of the gas inside the catalytic bed.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 448 2591 2180 2683;">
     Catalyst can degrade with time due to impurities and poisoning, particularly from sulphur compounds.
    </span>
    <span class="ocr_sent" title="bbox 447 2648 2181 2739;">
     Hence the fuel is processed to remove all the sulphur in catalyst-fitted cars.
